## 2026-02-19 - Enhanced CLI Visibility and Accessibility
**Learning:** In CLI environments, pairing ANSI color codes with explicit textual labels (e.g., [SECURE], [CRITICAL]) significantly improves both glanceability for power users and accessibility for users with color vision deficiencies or non-color terminals.
**Action:** Always include textual state indicators alongside color-coded UI elements in terminal applications.

## 2026-02-21 - Interactive Menu and User Feedback
**Learning:** Transitioning from one-shot execution to a persistent looping menu with clear exits improves the interactive experience. Providing immediate visual feedback for success/failure (e.g., green text for successful auth) and thematic progress bars enhances engagement.
**Action:** Implement persistent interactive loops for CLI tools and use color-coded status messages.
