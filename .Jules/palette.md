## 2026-02-18 - Accessible Threat Alerts

**Learning:** Color-coded status indicators in the CLI are effective but not accessible to color-blind users or those on non-color terminals. Pairing colors with distinct textual labels (e.g., 'SECURE', 'RED SQUIRREL ALERT') ensures that the critical state is communicated clearly across all environments.

**Action:** Updated the `SQUIRREL THREAT METER` to include textual status labels alongside ANSI colors.
