## 2026-02-17 - Accessible CLI Alerts
**Learning:** Color-coded status indicators in a CLI must be accompanied by textual labels to remain accessible to color-blind users and those on non-color terminals.
**Action:** Implemented a tiered threat system where ANSI colors (RED/YEL/GRN) are paired with clear textual labels like "RED SQUIRREL ALERT" and "SECURE".
