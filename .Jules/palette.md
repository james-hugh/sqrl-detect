## 2025-05-14 - [Visual Severity and Accessibility Labels]
**Learning:** In CLI-based monitoring tools, using colors alone for severity can exclude users with visual impairments or those using non-color terminals. Adding textual status labels (e.g., "SECURE", "CRITICAL") alongside color improves both accessibility and intuitive understanding.
**Action:** Always pair color-coded status indicators with clear textual labels to ensure accessibility and better user experience.
