## 2026-02-19 - Enhanced CLI Visibility and Accessibility
**Learning:** In CLI environments, pairing ANSI color codes with explicit textual labels (e.g., [SECURE], [CRITICAL]) significantly improves both glanceability for power users and accessibility for users with color vision deficiencies or non-color terminals.
**Action:** Always include textual state indicators alongside color-coded UI elements in terminal applications.

## 2026-02-20 - Main Menu Revamp and Visual Progress Indicators
**Learning:** A structured main menu loop provides a much better user experience by allowing users to explore multiple features without restarting the application. Real-time progress indicators (like the MOO synchronization bar) provide immediate feedback and maintain thematic immersion.
**Action:** Implemented a persistent main menu loop with color-coded options and added a thematic "MOO" protocol visualization with a progress meter.
