## 2025-02-16 - Color-Coded Status Labels
**Learning:** For CLI interfaces, pairing color-coded status indicators (like a red/yellow/green threat meter) with explicit textual labels (e.g., [RED SQUIRREL ALERT]) is crucial for accessibility. This ensures that users with color-blindness or those using non-color terminals can still interpret the UI accurately.
**Action:** Always include a descriptive text label whenever using color as a state indicator in the terminal.
