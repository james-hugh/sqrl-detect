## 2026-02-19 - Enhanced CLI Visibility and Accessibility
**Learning:** In CLI environments, pairing ANSI color codes with explicit textual labels (e.g., [SECURE], [CRITICAL]) significantly improves both glanceability for power users and accessibility for users with color vision deficiencies or non-color terminals.
**Action:** Always include textual state indicators alongside color-coded UI elements in terminal applications.

## 2026-02-21 - Interactive Menu Design and Feedback Loops
**Learning:** A structured main menu loop with clear, color-coded options and immediate visual feedback (like green success messages and progress bars) enhances the user's sense of control and system responsiveness in CLI tools.
**Action:** Implement persistent menu loops for interactive CLI applications and use ANSI colors to distinguish between primary actions and system states.
