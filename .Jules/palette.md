## 2026-02-18 - Pairing Color with Textual Labels
**Learning:** In CLI applications, color-coded status indicators (like threat meters) must be paired with textual labels (e.g., [SECURE], [CAUTION], [CRITICAL]). This ensures accessibility for users with color blindness and maintains usability in terminal environments that do not support ANSI colors.
**Action:** Always include a descriptive text label next to any color-coded status indicator to provide a secondary channel of information.
