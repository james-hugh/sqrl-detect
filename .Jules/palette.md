## 2026-02-19 - Enhanced CLI Visibility and Accessibility
**Learning:** In CLI environments, pairing ANSI color codes with explicit textual labels (e.g., [SECURE], [CRITICAL]) significantly improves both glanceability for power users and accessibility for users with color vision deficiencies or non-color terminals.
**Action:** Always include textual state indicators alongside color-coded UI elements in terminal applications.

## 2026-02-21 - Semantic Color Coding and Efficient Rendering in CLI
**Learning:** Applying semantic colors to CLI menus (e.g., Green for progress/primary, Red for exit/secondary) improves user decision speed. For dynamic visualizations like graphs, using %.*s precision specifiers with static templates provides a clean, flicker-free experience while maintaining performance.
**Action:** Use semantic color hierarchies for CLI navigation and favor precision specifiers over character-by-character loops for terminal-based rendering.
