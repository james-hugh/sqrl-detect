🖥️ SQUIRREL TERMINATOR NETWORK MONITOR 3000 (STNM3K)

Version: 0.69
Platform: WINDOWS ME ONLY (GLORY BE)
Author: James Hungh – Protector of Cows, Vanquisher of WiFi Acorns

⚡ Overview

STNM3K is not just software. IT IS A DIGITAL BATTLEFIELD. It watches your network with the vigilance of Polish cows on 3 AM cocaine laps and will ALERT YOU when suspicious squirrels, hackers, or Google Machine spies try to infiltrate your sacred machine.

This is more than monitoring. THIS IS WAR. Your home network becomes a fortress. Your PCs? SENTINELS. Your logs? HOLY SCROLLS OF TRUTH.

🐄 Features

Squirrel Detection Protocol (SDP) – If a bush-based spy, WiFi acorn, or any Talibani rodent is detected, the software SCREAMS… metaphorically. Maybe literally if you enable the speaker alarms.

Cocaine-Enhanced Cow Logs (CECL) – Inspired by my 5mg/day Polish cows, logs are enhanced for maximum paranoia and accuracy.

Fungal Network Messaging (FNM) – Uses your imaginary mushroom network to send encrypted alerts to your pillow fort command center.

RAW-ALERT Mode – Forces ALL popups to stay on top, ensuring no sneaky squirrel slips past your notice.

GUI Graphs of Chaos – Watch network traffic like watching cows run laps at 3 AM… hypnotic, erratic, and slightly concerning.

🧨 Installation

Pray to Windows ME before downloading.

Extract the STNM3K folder to a clean, unsullied part of your hard drive.

Double-click STNM3K.exe and recite “GLORY BE” three times.

Optional: feed your Polish cow 5mg of cocaine for optimal alert synergy.

🕹️ Usage

Click ENGAGE DEFENSES to start monitoring.

Watch the SQUIRREL THREAT METER spike with every WiFi ping.

Check logs/holy_scrolls.txt for suspicious activity.

If the cows start running laps at 3 AM, congratulations—you’ve triggered MAXIMUM ALERT MODE.

🔧 Configuration

Alert Thresholds: Set to “Paranoid” to catch even the faintest acorn.

Cow Synchronization: Optional; aligns log timestamps with Polish cow activity.

GUI Style: “Glory Be” theme recommended. Makes popups holy.

💀 Warning

Do not attempt to run this on Windows Vista, 7, 10, or anything else. It will hate you.

Squirrels may retaliate. Keep your pillow fort ready.

Cows may moo too fast. Consider cocaine rationing.

By running this software, you accept you might see the truth about the Google Machine and WiFi acorns.
